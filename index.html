                                <strong>Figure 1.2:</strong> The top of the body of the tool can be removed, thereby giving access to the internals. The DC motor (1) rotates the wire loop (3) and slides through the channel inside the body to retract and lengthen the wire loop. The rotation of the motor is translated through a copper coupler (2) to the wire loop (3) which ends up rotating at an axis perpendicular to the DC motor.

                                Cataract surgery, while considered to be a very safe procedure, experiences many of its small number of injuries during a specific portion of the surgery called phacoemulsification. During this portion of the surgery, the cloudy lens is broken down into small pieces and then sucked out of the eye through an irrigation and aspiration tool. Often, pieces of the lens are stuck to the delicate posterior wall of the lens capsule, where the lens sits inside. Tearing of the lens capsule can occur when bringing the irrigation and aspiration tool too close to the posterior wall of the capsule.
                                <br><br>
                                I was tasked with designing and prototyping an alternative hand tool under the supervision of Dr. Gerber to completely blend up the lens (even the pieces stuck to the posterior wall), so that the pieces of the lens can be safely sucked out of the eye without having to get close to the lens capsule. The hand tool features a finger-operated sliding DC motor that spins a wire loop of varying strength and ductility (currently testing fishing wire and copper wire) inside the lens capsule. The finger slide allows the wire to be retracted on entry into the eye and then when inside the eye, the wire loop expands to fill the lens capsule and break apart the lens.
                                <br><br>
                                I have designed two main iterations of the tool; the second iteration is shown in the two figures and video. The first iteration was large and complex. After speaking with a surgeon, I developed a final sleeker prototype giving the doctor direct control of the retraction with their finger instead of motorized retraction with buttons. He also commented on the importance of a small diameter and pen-like shape, since that is what surgeons are familiar with and causes the least visual obstruction.
                                <br><br>
                                We have been able to complete a prototype of the second iteration of the prototype by attaching a medical blunt-tipped cannula (essentially a very small metal tube) to the 3D-printed frame I designed in Solidworks. It was tested on a pig eye and showed promising results with the copper wire, except that it is not able to retract and extend easily to fill the lens capsule. The fishing wire was too flimsy to emulsify the lens.
                                <br><br>
                                In the future, we are looking into compliant mechanisms (mechanisms relying on flexures instead of joints) to eliminate the need for a wire loop and have a stronger and more reliable “loop” that fills the lens capsule and retracts very easily. I am excited about this tool's potential to make cataract surgery safer and easier!

Section 1 is the container that housed stacks of granola bars (each different colored container in section 1 is a different vertical stack of granola bars). Section 2 is the system for pushing the granola bars out of section 1 and onto the conveyor belt (section 5). Sections 3 and 4 are the arm and hand that catch the granola bars that come off of the conveyor belt and bring them up for students to grab. Section 5 is the conveyor belt that brings the bars from section 2 to the hand.

                                  During my second year at UCLA, I was a part of X1 Robotics, an American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) student-led project team. We designed and built BruinBot! BruinBot is a small campus-roving robot that drives around interacting with students by saying "hi," giving fist bumps, giving out flyers, and handing out snacks. I was a part of the payload subteam that was responsible for handing out snacks, high-fiving, and fist-bumping students. The payload system is shown and described in Figure 3.2. 
                                  <br><br>
                                  A description of the overall payload system is shown in Figure 3.2. I was responsible for creating the system to push the granola bars out of the container (shown together in Figure 3.3). I got inspiration from the x-axis of a 3D printer and created a linear track driven by a stepper motor timing-belt framework (shown in Figure 3.4) that would allow the linear pusher (shown in Figure 3.5) to accurately move laterally. Once the linear pusher is positioned using the linear track, then the linear pusher uses a simple rack and pinion system to push the rack forward to dislodge the granola bars.
                                  <br><br>
                                  Sadly, due to COVID-19 the last quarter of my second year was completely remote, we were only able to finish designing Bruinbot. All of the labs closed down and are still closed down so we have not been able to build Bruinbot. Hopefully UCLA will reopen soon and we will be able to get back to safely building Bruinbot!
